## Technical Rationale

### Proposed Architecture

#### Data Acquisition Layer
**Primary Data Sources:**
- **Policy Administration System**: 2.3M active policies, premium calculations, renewals
- **Claims Management System**: 450K annual claims, settlement data, adjuster notes
- **Customer Relationship Management**: 1.8M customer records, interaction history
- **Financial Systems**: General ledger, accounts receivable, commission tracking
- **Agent Portal**: Sales data, commission structures, performance metrics
- **External Sources**: Credit bureaus, weather data, regulatory filings

#### Recommended Architecture: Data-Mart Bus (Kimball Architecture)

**Why Data-Mart Bus is Optimal for Our Insurance Environment:**

The Data-Mart Bus architecture aligns perfectly with our bottom-up implementation strategy and insurance industry requirements. This approach creates a series of integrated data marts connected through standardized, conformed dimensions.

**Core Components:**
- **Conformed Dimensions**: Standardized dimension tables (Customer, Policy, Time, Geography) shared across all data marts
- **Subject-Area Data Marts**: Independent but integrated marts for Underwriting, Claims, Customer Analytics
- **Enterprise Data Bus**: Logical integration layer ensuring dimensional consistency
- **Staging Areas**: Dedicated ETL processing zones for each data mart

**Architecture Comparison Analysis:**

| Architecture Type | Fit for Insurance | Implementation Risk | Time to Value | Scalability |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Data-Mart Bus** ✓ | **Excellent** | **Low** | **Fast** | **High** |
| Centralized EDW | Good | High | Slow | Medium |
| Independent Data Marts | Poor | Medium | Fast | Poor |
| Federated | Fair | High | Medium | Medium |
| Hub-and-Spoke | Good | Medium | Medium | High |

**Why Data-Mart Bus Wins:**

**Insurance Industry Alignment:**
- Insurance naturally organizes around business functions (Underwriting, Claims, Marketing)
- Regulatory reporting often follows departmental boundaries
- Different departments have varying analytical maturity levels

**Technical Advantages:**
- **Conformed Dimensions**: Ensures consistent definitions of Customer, Policy, Time across all marts
- **Incremental Growth**: Add new data marts without disrupting existing ones
- **Performance**: Each mart optimized for specific analytical workloads
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain smaller, focused data marts than monolithic warehouse

**Business Benefits:**
- **Faster ROI**: Each data mart delivers value independently while building toward enterprise view
- **Lower Risk**: Failure in one mart doesn't impact others
- **User Adoption**: Department-specific marts match user mental models
- **Scalability**: Can easily add new subject areas (Reinsurance, Regulatory, etc.)

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Establish Conformed Dimensions**: Customer, Policy, Agent, Geography, Time
2. **Build Underwriting Data Mart**: First implementation using conformed dimensions
3. **Extend to Claims Data Mart**: Reuses Customer and Policy dimensions, adds Claims-specific facts
4. **Add Customer Analytics**: Leverages all existing dimensions, adds behavioral metrics
5. **Enterprise Integration**: Logical views across all marts for executive reporting

**Why Other Architectures Are Less Suitable:**

**Centralized Corporate Data Warehouse (Inman):**
- High upfront investment and risk
- Slower time-to-value (18+ months)
- Less agile for changing business requirements

**Independent Data Marts:**
- Creates new data silos
- Inconsistent metrics across departments
- No enterprise-wide analytical capability

**Federated Architecture:**
- High complexity in insurance regulatory environment
- Performance issues for complex cross-system queries
- Requires sophisticated metadata management

**Hub-and-Spoke:**
- Good for operational reporting but less optimal for analytics
- More complex ETL processing
- Higher maintenance overhead

**Data Storage Layer Architecture:**
- **Staging Area**: Temporary storage for data cleansing and validation
- **Conformed Dimension Repository**: Master dimensions shared across all data marts
- **Subject-Area Data Marts**: Underwriting, Claims, Customer Analytics, Financial marts
- **Enterprise Logical Layer**: Cross-mart reporting and analytics views

### Data Flow Architecture: Kimball Data-Mart Bus Implementation

**Overview of Data Flow Process:**

The data flow in our Data-Mart Bus architecture follows Kimball's methodology of building conformed dimensions first, then populating fact tables across multiple subject-area data marts that share these standardized dimensions.

**Stage 1: Conformed Dimension Processing**

**Dimension Table Creation (Master Data Management):**
1. **Customer Dimension Processing:**
   - Extract customer data from Policy Admin System, CRM, Claims System
   - Apply standardization rules (address formatting, name consistency)
   - Create master customer records with business keys
   - Generate surrogate keys for warehouse use
   - Load into shared Customer Dimension table

2. **Policy Dimension Processing:**
   - Extract policy data from Policy Administration System
   - Standardize product codes and coverage types
   - Create policy hierarchy (Product Line → Product → Coverage)
   - Handle slowly changing dimensions (Type 2 for premium changes)
   - Load into shared Policy Dimension table

3. **Agent Dimension Processing:**
   - Extract agent data from Agent Portal and Commission Systems
   - Create agent hierarchy (Region → Branch → Agent)
   - Handle agent transfers and status changes
   - Load into shared Agent Dimension table

4. **Time and Geography Dimensions:**
   - Generate comprehensive time dimension (daily grain with fiscal periods)
   - Create geography hierarchy (State → County → ZIP)
   - Load reference data for consistent date/location analytics

**Stage 2: Data Mart Specific Processing**

**Underwriting Data Mart Flow:**
```
Source Systems → Staging → Dimension Processing → Fact Table Loading
    ↓              ↓           ↓                    ↓
Policy Admin → Stage_Policy → [Reuse Conformed] → Underwriting_Facts
Rating Engine → Stage_Quotes     Dimensions      → Quote_Facts  
Commission → Stage_Commission                     → Commission_Facts
```

**Detailed Underwriting ETL Process:**
1. **Extract**: Pull new/changed policies, quotes, and commission data
2. **Transform**: 
   - Apply business rules for risk classification
   - Calculate derived metrics (loss ratios, premium per policy)
   - Handle policy renewals and endorsements
3. **Load Facts**: 
   - Create fact records with foreign keys to conformed dimensions
   - Maintain additive measures (premiums, policies) and semi-additive (balances)
   - Handle late-arriving facts (policies sold but reported later)

**Claims Data Mart Flow:**
```
Source Systems → Staging → Dimension Processing → Fact Table Loading
    ↓              ↓           ↓                    ↓
Claims System → Stage_Claims → [Reuse Customer,] → Claims_Facts
Adjuster Notes → Stage_Notes     Policy, Time   → Settlement_Facts
Legal System → Stage_Legal       Dimensions]     → Legal_Facts
                              → [Add Claims-     → Reserve_Facts
                                 Specific Dims]
```

**Claims-Specific Process:**
1. **Extract**: Pull claims, settlements, reserves, and related data
2. **Transform**:
   - Link claims to policies using business keys
   - Calculate claim development patterns
   - Apply fraud scoring algorithms
   - Handle claim status changes and reopenings
3. **Load Facts**:
   - Create grain at claim transaction level
   - Maintain reserve amounts as semi-additive facts
   - Handle multiple settlements per claim

**Stage 3: Cross-Mart Integration**

**Enterprise Bus Integration:**
- **Conformed Fact Consistency**: Ensure policy counts match between Underwriting and Claims marts
- **Cross-Mart Drill-Through**: Enable navigation from Underwriting metrics to related Claims data
- **Aggregate Fact Tables**: Build summary tables spanning multiple subject areas
- **Enterprise Reporting Layer**: Create logical views combining data from multiple marts

**Data Quality and Lineage Tracking:**

**Quality Checkpoints Throughout Flow:**
1. **Source Validation**: Check completeness and format of extracted data
2. **Business Rule Validation**: Ensure premium calculations follow underwriting rules
3. **Referential Integrity**: Verify all fact records link to valid dimension records
4. **Cross-Mart Consistency**: Validate that shared dimensions remain synchronized
5. **Audit Trail**: Log all transformations and data lineage for compliance

**Incremental Processing Strategy:**

**Daily Operational Updates:**
- **New Business**: Process new policies and quotes from previous day
- **Claims Activity**: Load new claims, payments, and status changes
- **Customer Updates**: Handle address changes, policy modifications

**Monthly Comprehensive Updates:**
- **Commission Processing**: Load monthly commission calculations
- **Financial Close**: Reconcile premium and claims financial data
- **Dimension Maintenance**: Process agent transfers, territory changes

**Annual Dimension Updates:**
- **Product Changes**: Handle new insurance products and coverage modifications
- **Organizational Changes**: Update agent and branch hierarchies
- **Regulatory Updates**: Modify state and coverage requirement dimensions

**Performance Optimization in Data Flow:**

**Parallel Processing:**
- Process independent data marts simultaneously
- Use separate ETL streams for different fact tables within each mart
- Leverage cloud auto-scaling during peak processing windows

**Incremental Loading:**
- Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time source system changes
- Date-based extraction for batch-oriented source systems
- Surrogate key caching to optimize dimension lookups

**Error Handling and Recovery:**
- Failed record quarantine and reprocessing capabilities
- Rollback procedures for each data mart independently
- Automated alerts for data quality threshold violations

This data flow design ensures that each data mart can be developed and maintained independently while sharing the foundational conformed dimensions that enable enterprise-wide analytics and consistent reporting across all insurance business functions.
