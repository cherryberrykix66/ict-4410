## DATA CRISIS: The Problem Statement

https://cherryberrykix66.github.io/ict-4410/week_02_rmig_data_crisis.html

Greetings! Today I'm presenting a critical initiative that will transform how Rocky Mountain Insurance Group leverages data for competitive advantage. Our current data landscape is costing us money and opportunities every single day.

Right now, we have a data fragmentation crisis. Our policy data lives in one system, claims in another, and customer service in a third. When Finance reports 15% growth and Sales reports 18% for the same period, we know we have a problem. Our analysts spend 60% of their time gathering data rather than analyzing it. Our executive dashboards are two to three weeks behind actual performance.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to "Current Data Fragmentation Problems"]**</span>

This fragmentation is costing us $850,000 annually in duplicated reporting efforts, $420,000 in delayed decision-making costs, and $300,000 in compliance risks from inconsistent regulatory reporting. We're also missing significant opportunities because we cannot perform cross-functional analysis.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to "Total Annual Impact"]**</span>

The current state of our data systems is having a total annual impact of $1.57 million. How do we rightsize this deficit due to lost efficiencies and opportunities? The answer is to pursue an unified data warehouse architecture. This is a centralized data warehouse capable of eliminating the data silos currently hindering our operational efforts. 


## ARCHITECTURE: The Solution: Data Warehouse Architecture 

https://cherryberrykix66.github.io/ict-4410/week_02_rmig_architecture_page.html

The solution is a comprehensive data warehouse built on the proven Data-Mart Bus architecture. This approach is specifically designed for insurance companies like Rocky Mountain Insurance Group, where business functions naturally organize around underwriting, claims, and customer analytics.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to 3-column layout with "DATA STORAGE" center column]**</span>

The architecture centers on conformed dimensions that provide consistent definitions of customers, policies, agents, and time across all data marts. These shared dimensions ensure that when we talk about a customer retention rate in marketing, it means exactly the same thing as customer retention in underwriting.

Our data acquisition layer will pull from our Policy Administration System with 2.3 million active policies, our Claims Management System with 450,000 annual claims, and our Customer Relationship Management system with 1.8 million customer records. 

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to GREEN "Metadata Repository" bar]**</span>

Also - the system will process 50 gigabytes of data daily and maintain a 2 terabyte historical repository.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to PURPLE "Key Benefits for Rocky Mountain Insurance Group" bar]**</span>

The Data-Mart Bus architecture is optimal for Rocky Mountain's insurance environment because it allows incremental implementation while ensuring enterprise-wide consistency. Each data mart delivers independent value while building toward a comprehensive analytical platform. This approach significantly reduces risk compared to a monolithic data warehouse while providing faster time-to-value.

## ROI ANALYSIS: Financial Impact and ROI

## ROI ANALYSIS: Implementation Approach 

<span style="color: red;">**[STAY at BOTTOM of ROI ANALYSIS page]**</span>

We're following Ralph Kimball's proven bottom-up methodology, which is specifically suited for insurance companies. This approach delivers working solutions in 4 to 6 months rather than the 12 to 18 months required for a top-down enterprise data warehouse.

Phase One focuses on our Underwriting Data Mart over the first 6 months with a $1.2 million investment. This will integrate policy data, create risk factor dimensional modeling, and deliver underwriting performance dashboards. The expected return is $800,000 annually through improved loss ratios.

Phase Two builds our Claims Data Mart in months 7 through 12 with an $850,000 investment. This will provide claims severity and frequency analysis, fraud detection analytics, and settlement optimization. The expected return is $600,000 annually in claims cost reduction.

Phase Three delivers Customer Analytics in months 13 through 18 with a $750,000 investment. This enables customer lifecycle analysis, churn prediction, and marketing campaign effectiveness measurement, generating $550,000 annually in improved retention.

Phase Four completes enterprise integration in months 19 through 24 with a $400,000 investment, delivering executive-level integrated reporting and regulatory compliance automation worth $1.2 million annually in operational efficiency gains.


## DATA FLOW: Data Flow and ETL Architecture

https://cherryberrykix66.github.io/ict-4410/week_02_rmig_data_flow_page.html

Our data warehouse implementation follows Ralph Kimball's proven Extract-Transform-Load methodology, specifically designed for dimensional modeling and business intelligence. This approach ensures data quality, consistency, and optimal performance for analytical workloads.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to the 4-step flow diagram with Extract → Transform → Load → Deliver with detailed four columns below]**</span>

The extraction phase connects to our critical source systems using secure protocols and change data capture technology. We'll extract from our Policy Administration System containing 2.3 million active policies, our Claims Management System with 450,000 annual claims, our Customer Relationship Management system with 1.8 million customer records, and our financial systems. The extraction process handles various data formats including databases, flat files, and API endpoints while maintaining complete audit trails.

The transformation phase is where we add significant business value. We apply comprehensive data cleansing and standardization rules as well as implement complex business logic and calculations. This is also where we create our conformed dimensions that ensure consistency across all data marts. Recall that our conformed dimension are customers, policies, agents, and time. In addtion, the transformation phase generates surrogate keys for the warehouse, handles slowly changing dimensions using Type 2 methodology to preserve historical context, and validates referential integrity and business rules.

The loading phase follows dimensional modeling best practices by loading dimensions before fact tables, populating fact tables with proper foreign keys, and updating aggregate and summary tables for optimal query performance. We maintain complete data lineage and audit trails, optimize indexes and partitions for our insurance-specific query patterns, and validate all loaded data against source systems.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to "Daily Processing Timeline" visual]**</span>

Our daily processing schedule ensures fresh data is available for business users every morning. 
1. Processing begins at midnight with extraction, 
2. moves to transformation and validation at 2 AM, 
3. loads data marts by 4 AM, 
4. and updates all reports and dashboards by 6 AM. 
This schedule provides current data for daily operations while minimizing impact on source systems.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to "Data Quality & Performance Metrics" section]**</span>

Our technical approach ensures enterprise-grade performance and governance. The system will maintain 99.5% availability with query response times under 5 seconds. We're implementing robust data quality monitoring with 95% completeness, 99.9% percent system uptime, and comprehensive automated quality monitoring, exception reporting, and performance optimization. The system will process 50 gigabytes daily, support over 500 concurrent users, and provide 24/7 monitoring and support.

We're building robust security with role-based access control, data encryption, and comprehensive audit logging for regulatory compliance to ensure our insurance data meets all industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## METADATA: Comprehensive Metadata Architecture

https://cherryberrykix66.github.io/ict-4410/week_02_rmig_metadata_page.html

Metadata is the foundation that transforms our data warehouse from a technical repository into a true business intelligence platform. Our comprehensive metadata architecture ensures that Rocky Mountain Insurance Group's data warehouse becomes self-documenting, self-service, and enterprise-ready. We're implementing comprehensive metadata management that makes the system self-documenting and enables true self-service analytics for business users.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to the three metadata layers: Business, Technical, and Operational]**</span>

The metadata architecture includes business definitions, technical lineage, and operational monitoring. Our Business Metadata Layer provides clear, business-friendly definitions for all metrics, calculations, and KPIs. Business users will find clear definitions of every metric, understand calculation methods, and see data quality indicators. We're assigning business stewards and owners for each data subject area, documenting business rules and calculation methods, and providing usage guidelines with context on data interpretation and known limitations.

The Technical Metadata Layer provides complete data lineage from source systems through transformations to final reports and dashboards. Technical staff will have complete impact analysis capabilities and automated documentation with detailed schema documentation, transformation logic documentation, and comprehensive dependency mapping for impact analysis. This enables rapid change management and reduces the risk of unintended consequences when modifying systems.

Our Operational Metadata Layer monitors system performance with ETL job statistics, data quality metrics, usage analytics, and comprehensive error logging. This provides operational staff with real-time visibility into system health, data quality issues, and user behavior patterns.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to "Metadata Creation and Maintenance Flow"]**</span>

The metadata creation process follows a four-step workflow: 
1. capture metadata automatically from source systems
2. enrich it with business context
3. validate for quality assurance
4. and publish to make it available to users. 
This ensures metadata remains current and accurate while minimizing manual maintenance overhead.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to the four benefit cards]**</span>

This metadata architecture delivers transformative benefits. Self-service discovery enables business users to find and understand data independently, reducing IT dependency by 60% and accelerating time-to-insight from weeks to hours. Complete data lineage enables rapid impact analysis for system changes, reducing project risk and implementation time by 40%. Automated audit trails ensure regulatory compliance and support examination processes. Continuous quality monitoring with automated alerts ensures data reliability and business confidence in analytics.

<span style="color: red;">**[scroll down to "Metadata Governance Framework"]**</span>

We're establishing a comprehensive governance framework with assigned data stewards responsible for business metadata accuracy, technical stewards maintaining system documentation, formal quality standards for metadata completeness, and approved change control processes for metadata updates and version management.

Our target metrics include 95% metadata coverage, 24/7 availability, documentation for over 500 data elements, and 99.5% accuracy rates. This comprehensive metadata foundation transforms our data warehouse into a truly self-service analytical platform that empowers business users while maintaining enterprise-grade governance and control.
